        "description": "A fully interactive web-based desktop operating system simulator built with SvelteKit that recreates the classic Windows 95/98 experience in the browser. This project features a complete desktop environment with draggable windows, a functional taskbar, start menu, desktop icons, context menus, and authentic Windows sound effects. Users can interact with various applications including a chatbot, audio oscillator, numerology calculator, guestbook, and portfolio viewer. The OS simulator includes authentic boot screens, window management, icon positioning, and responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices. It's deployed on GitHub Pages and serves as both a nostalgic throwback and a showcase of modern web development techniques.",
